# OONI assembly

To engage with 34C3 participants, we’ll be hosting an assembly called
[OONI-verse](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:OONI-verse)
(part of the [Rights & Freedoms Orbit](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Cluster:Rights_%26_Freedoms)).
This is a space where you can find us to learn all about OONI, ask
questions, share skills, knowledge, and ideas. We’ll be showcasing our
tools and may offer workshops upon request.

You can also just drop by to say hi and collect some OONI stickers:
