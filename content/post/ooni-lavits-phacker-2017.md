Earlier this month we had the opportunity to present OONI at two conferences in Chile: LAVITS and Primavera Hacker.

## LAVITS

[LAVITS](http://lavits.org) is a Latin American network of surveillance
technology and society studies that organizes international symposiums since
2009. It features publications, talks and workshops related to
surveillance and technology, internet censorship, resistance and counter
surveillance, identification, biometrics, protection of personal data and
privacy. The fifth series of the [LAVITS symposium](http://lavits2017.datosprotegidos.org/) took place in Santiago, Chile from 29th November to 1st December 2017. 

As part of the symposium, we presented a research paper (pending
publication) titled: *Network interference in LATAM: Evaluating network
measurements to detect information controls, internet censorship and
surveillance*. We also facilitated OONI and Tor workshops.

## Primavera Hacker

The 5th version of [Primavera Hacker](https://phacker.org/), an event bringing together hackers, activists, technologists,
and feminists, took place in Santiago, Chile on 2nd and 3rd
December 2017. We [presented OONI](https://www.phacker.org/programa.html#charla_ooni) and facilitated OONI and Tor [workshops](https://www.phacker.org/programa.html#actividad_tor_meetup) for Latin American communities.
